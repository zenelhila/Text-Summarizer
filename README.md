# Text-Summarizer

Time is probably one of the most important things we have and we try to save as much as we
can from it. We come across thousands of articles or reports in our daily life, which we read
and try to improve ourselves with that certain information. We try to read as much as we can,
but whenever we see a long text, whatever it might be, we avoid it most of the time, even though
it might contain useful information. That long text might be explained and delivered in a less
number of lines and it would be an amazing solution to save us time and much more effort. This
project contains software that will be able to summarize a certainly given text. It can summarize different
texts, starting from reports, newspapers, or even notes. NLP (Natural Language Processing) is an area
of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with how to design computers to
process and evaluate enormous volumes of language data.
By using NLTK, SpaCy and Gensim, we can summarize whatever kind of text in fewer sentences.
